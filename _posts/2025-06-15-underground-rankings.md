This web app was created as a fun, community-driven way for hip-hop fans to rank their favorite underground rappers and discover emerging talent. As someone who is big into underground rap, I wanted to create a platform that makes it easy and engaging to compare rappers while helping lesser-known artists gain recognition.

The app turns ranking rappers into an interactive game, using an ELO-based voting system similar to chess rankings. Users can vote on head-to-head matchups between artists, creating a dynamic leaderboard that evolves with the community's preferences. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase, the app delivers a smooth, real-time experience that makes discovering new music both fun and meaningful.

Key features include:

Head-to-Head Battles: Voting on matchups between underground rappers, making it feel like a game while building a comprehensive ranking system.

Discover New Artists: The intelligent matchmaking system introduces you to rappers you might not have heard before, helping emerging talent get discovered.

Community Rankings: See how your favorite underground artists stack up against others in the community-driven leaderboard.

Personal Profile: Track your voting history and see which artists you've supported the most, creating a personalized experience.

Easy to Use: Clean, responsive design that works great on any device, making it simple to vote and discover new music on the go.

Real-Time Updates: Watch the rankings change instantly as the community votes, keeping the competition exciting and dynamic.
