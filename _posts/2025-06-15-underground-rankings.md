This web app was created as a fun, community-driven way for hip-hop fans to rank their favorite underground rappers and discover emerging talent. As someone who is big into underground rap, I wanted to create a platform that makes it easy and engaging to compare rappers while helping lesser-known artists gain recognition.

The app turns ranking rappers into an interactive game, using an ELO-based voting system similar to chess rankings. Users can vote on head-to-head matchups between artists, creating a dynamic leaderboard that evolves with the community's preferences. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase, the app delivers a smooth, real-time experience that makes discovering new music both fun and meaningful.

Key features include:

Head-to-Head Battles: Voting on matchups between underground rappers, making it feel like a game while building a comprehensive ranking system. Each artist profile is enriched with their top tracks, allowing users to make informed decisions based on their music.

Discover New Artists: The intelligent matchmaking system introduces you to rappers you might not have heard before, helping emerging talent get discovered. Powered by Spotify's API, the system provides detailed artist profiles, including their popularity scores, follower counts, and genre classifications.

Community Rankings: See how your favorite underground artists stack up against others in the community-driven leaderboard. The rankings are enhanced with real-time Spotify data, including artist popularity metrics and genre information.

Personal Profile: Track your voting history and see which artists you've supported the most, creating a personalized experience. Your profile also shows which artists' tracks you've previewed through the integrated Spotify player.

Easy to Use: Clean, responsive design that works great on any device, making it simple to vote and discover new music on the go. The Spotify integration allows for instant track previews and artist information without leaving the app.

Real-Time Updates: Watch the rankings change instantly as the community votes, keeping the competition exciting and dynamic. The platform stays current with artist data through regular Spotify API updates.

Music Discovery: Preview tracks directly in the app using Spotify's embedded player, making it easy to discover new music while voting. The system automatically suggests related underground artists based on Spotify's recommendation engine.
